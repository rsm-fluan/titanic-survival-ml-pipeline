# Titanic Survival Prediction – Machine Learning Pipeline

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow for a binary
classification problem using the Titanic dataset.

The goal is to predict passenger survival using demographic and ticket-related features.

## Project Highlights
- Built an end-to-end ML pipeline
- Implemented logistic regression from scratch
- Applied feature engineering (one-hot encoding, scaling)
- Compared with a scikit-learn baseline

## Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Notes
Dataset files are not included in this repository.
